                <h1>Welcome</h1>
                <p>Welcome to the personal website of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-n-martin/">Jeremy Nicolas Martin</a>.</p>
                <p>
                    I am a French mathematician based in Paris, France. My academic journey took me through some of France‚Äôs most esteemed institutions, such as <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/">√âcole Polytechnique</a> and <a href="https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/" target="_blank">Pierre and Marie Curie University</a>, where I honed my expertise in pure and applied mathematics. My professional experience has spanned various fields, including computer science, life sciences, artificial intelligence, epistemology, anthropology, and value theory, with a consistent focus on innovation and societal advancement.
                </p>
                <p></p> 
                <p>
                    I founded and currently lead the research department of <a href="https://www.smart-chain.fr/en" target="_blank">Smart-Chain</a>, a pioneering lab dedicated to blockchain and AI. I aim to bridge theoretical constructs with practical implementations to accelerate the adoption of technological progress and achieve sustainable outcomes more efficiently. Previously, I led significant projects in various sectors, including econonomics and value exchange, through my involvement with multiple organizations. I also funded the <a href="https://cabinetduplateau.fr/">Cabinet Du Plateau</a>, a medical office that provides comprehensive care to patients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite my deep involvement in management roles, I found my passion lies in research rather than traditional management. I prefer to contribute through intellectual rigor and scientific exploration, even though I often lead high-profile teams. My academic contributions also extend to education, where I developed a master‚Äôs program in digital technology, fostering partnerships with major institutions to advance the field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of my professional pursuits, I am a black belt in karate and maintain a rigorous health regimen inspired by longevity research. My relentless curiosity and passion for knowledge have also led me to become a member of the prestigious <a href="https://www.triplenine.org/">Triple Nine Society</a> and the <a href="https://www.thethousand.com/">International Society for Philosophical Enquiry (ISPE)</a>. Both organizations demand the highest standards of intellectual excellence, requiring a verified IQ in the top 0.1% of the population. In these societies, I engage with other like-minded individuals to further explore the boundaries of human knowledge and contribute to intellectual and philosophical progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My life has been shaped by a series of unique and transformative experiences, from childhood accidents that challenged my resilience to academic achievements. These diverse moments have fostered an unyielding drive to push the limits of understanding and innovation. Whether in mathematical discourse or engineering groundbreaking solutions, my aim is to continuously elevate my comprehension of reality while making a meaningful impact on society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I embark on new projects and personal milestones, I remain steadfast in my commitment to balance professional excellence with personal fulfillment. My journey is defined by an insatiable quest for knowledge, a pursuit that compels me to challenge the frontiers of technology and thought. I invite you to connect with me ‚Äîwhether for collaborative ventures or engaging discussions‚Äî there is always more to learn and explore.
                </p>
